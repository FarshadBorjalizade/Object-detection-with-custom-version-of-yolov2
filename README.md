# Object-detection-with-custom-version-of-yolov2
In the computer vision, object detection has always been considered one of the most challenging
issues because it requires classifying and locating objects in the same scene. Many object detection
approaches were recently proposed based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which have
been demonstrated to achieve outstanding object detection performance compared to other approaches.
However, the supervised training of DCNNs mostly uses gradient-based optimization criteria, in which
all parameters of hidden layers require multiple iterations, and often faces some problems such as
local minima, intensive human intervention, time-consuming, etc.

In this project I try to compile object detection with custom version of yolov2
